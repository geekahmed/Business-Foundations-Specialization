## Notes

### Week 1. BRANDING: Marketing Strategy and Brand Positioning
- The essence of marketing is to have a very strong brand.
- Marketing is the studies of a market.
- A market is an exchange between two partners, frequently a buyer and a seller, but marketing also, applies to non-profit or things where there isn't necessarily money being transacted.
- The seller's market what that means is the seller has a product, and if you want that product, you have to come to the seller.
	- The seller has all the power.
	- Product-focus market.
		- If the customers want it, they're going to come to you.
	- The goal of the business owner is to focus on the product by:
		- Developing it to the best of the ability.
		- Innovate new features.
		- Reduce costs.
	- Business objective is to sell as much as possible and the profit come from the volume of selling.
	- Tied to the market share. 
	- It is called "inside-out"
- The buyer's market where there's lots of competition, a lot of products out there, and the buyer has the power.
	- Customer focused marketing means that I need to focus on the customer to get that customer to buy from me rather than the competition.
		- Look at what that customer wants, and deliver a product that meets the needs of that customer.
	- It is called "outside-in"
	- Customers segmentation is the key concept in delivering value.
	- The profit comes from creating value not volume.
	- Customer share is that I go after a more narrow market and try to get more from each of that, their, those customer's wallets.
	- Loyalty is more profitable because it's the cost of delivering value to the customer.
		- When I'm doing a customer based marketing it's actually quite expensive to give the customer exactly what they want. Once I figure out what that customer wants and I deliver it to them the first time, it's cheaper to deliver it to them time after time.
		- It's more difficult and more expensive to acquire new customers, but its cheaper to retain those customers over time.
	- Cross selling is an important process in this type of marketing.
- Marketing now has to focus on authentic, genuine customer value.
- The four P's of marketing are
	- Product
	- Place
	- Promotion
	- Price
- Market-driven principles
	- Know your markets
		- Know what customers want
		- Know how the competitors react
	- Customers have the final say
		- Three bundels customers form to take a descision
			- Operations factors: price, cost, delivery, service, reliability.
			- Product features or designs: attributes style, innovation, technology
			- Whether or not it meets my needs
		- Customers classify and give a score ffor these dimensions and then decide which one of those dimensions is the most important to them and they pick the product that's the best on one of those dimensions and good enough on the other two.
	- Commit to be the first in the market you serve
	- Deliver total quality to guarantee customer satisfaction
- STP framework refers to segmentation, targeting and positioning.
- Market segmentation is the process of dividing up the market into distinct subsets, where any subset could conceivably be selected and then you pick one of those market seqments to be your target. And you reach or you deliver to that customer segment, that market segment, with a distinct marketing mix (Marketing 4 P's).
- The segmenting may be based on
	- Demographics / characteristics of the customer
	- Product benefits sought by the customer
	-   Systematic/product-related behaviors (e.g. online vs in-store purchasers)
- Formally a brand is just a trademark. If you have a brand you want to legally protect your brand and trademark it.
- Conceptually, a brand is a contract from the company to its customers; a promise of specific benefits, quality and value. It is a relationship.
- A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is - it is what consumers tell each other it is.
- The three pieces to the positioning statement are:
	- target segment
	- point of difference
	- frame of reference: who are the other competitors that they are comparing themselves to?
- A brand should have a crisp target segment. Even if that's not the only people who use the product.
- Positioning should be clear and simple and focus on a few key benefits.
- The position must be defensible, so you want to take a positioning that you own and that other people can't copy very easily.
- The really important thing is you cannot be everything to everyone.
